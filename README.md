### Hi, I’m [Charlie](https://twitter.com/charliermarsh).

I’m building [Astral](https://astral.sh): high-performance developer tools for Python, starting with ⚡ [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) ⚡, an extremely fast Python linter and code transformation toolchain written in Rust.

My goal is to make the Python ecosystem more productive by building [faster developer tools](https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster).

I was most recently a staff software engineer at [Spring Discovery](https://www.springdiscovery.com/). Before that, I was a senior software engineer at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).

The best way to track my work is to follow me on [Twitter (@charliermarsh)](https://twitter.com/charliermarsh). The best way to get in touch is to DM me on [Twitter (@charliermarsh)](https://twitter.com/charliermarsh).
